    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <b>AKINSULIRE OLUWASEUN GRATITUDE</b>. I am a Nigerian and a student
      at Altschool, my Altschool ID is <b>ALT/SOE/023/2434</b>. I am currently a student of
      <b>OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIVERSITY</b> studying Medical rehabilitation(Physiotherapy).
      I decided to pursue a career in tech to broaden my Knowledge and add more
      to my area of expertise. I believe this decision will turn out to be
      something I'm proud of in the next couple of months. It has not been an
      easy and soft Journey so far here at Altschool but I believe with time,
      everything will fall in place.
